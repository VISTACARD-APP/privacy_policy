Article 9. Transfers of data outside the European Union
Concerning the nature of its activity, VISTACARD is led to carrying out transfers of your data to subcontractors outside the European Union.
VISTACARD makes certain commitments on this subject.
Recipients
First of all, VISTACARD does not transfer your data that it processes to third parties other than its internal services and service providers for the purposes of the processing, or to the legally authorized authorities at their request. When VISTACARD acts as a subcontractor, the only service provider acting as a subsequent subcontractor is GOOGLE which hosts the service in several European countries and outside the European Union.
In other words, VISTACARD does not give access to the data processed in its own interest or that of its customers to any partner whatsoever.
Providers
When VISTACARD uses service providers to provide it with certain tools or services involving personal data, the territory of the European Union will be systematically privileged as far as possible.
Exit from the Union with adequate protection by default
If the processing requirements imply an exit from the Union, VISTACARD favors the territories and entities which are the subject of an adequacy decision by the European Commission.
Formalization of adequate protection
If processing in the territory of the Union or in a territory benefiting from default protection proves to be impossible or unsuitable, VISTACARD could consider another type of transfer. In such a situation, VISTACARD undertakes to put in place adequate contractual protection, except in exceptional cases exhaustively listed by the GDPR.

Article 10. Security
VISTACARD and its possible subcontractors undertake to implement every technical and organizational measure to ensure the security of our processing of personal data and their confidentiality, in application of the Law on Computing and Freedom and the European General Data Protection Regulations (GDPR). 

Consequently, VISTACARD takes useful precautions regarding the nature of your data and the risks incurred by our processing, to preserve data security and in particular prevent them from deformation, damage or access by unauthorized third parties.

Inherent to its design, VISTACARD incorporates several levels of protection: secured data transfer, encryption, network configuration and controls of applications and users, distributed over an open-ended and secured infrastructure. 

Thus, VISTACARD implements the following measures:
* The files stored in are encrypted using AES (Advanced Encryption Standard), 256 bits.
*  uses the SSL/TLS (Secure Sockets Layer/Transport Layer Security) protocol to protect the data during transfer between the application and the servers.
* We regularly test the applications and infrastructure to identify possible breaches in security, strengthen their security and protect them against attacks.
